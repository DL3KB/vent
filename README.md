# vent
Open source ventilator design which uses parts that are easy to get.

Main component in this design is a Arduino. 
The design uses parts which are available to everyone like a lambda sensor from a car or a 12v tire compressor.

One of the most expensive and difficult parts in a ventilator are the valves and pressure regulators. They have to regulate the pressure to mbars. The solution for this problem is to use a simple mechanical pressure regulator for common applications like argon gas bottle (welding), propane gas (cooking), ... in combination with a stepper motor. To get such low pressures the pressure of the tank has to be low, therefore you need a bigger tank. This is no problem, because space does not matter too much.


Feel free to copy my design and add some things. I will start working on the software and add it to the rep.
